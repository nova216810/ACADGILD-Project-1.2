Problem Statement
-----------------
1.In this problem statement we will find the average fare of each class.(HIVE)

use default;
set hive.cli.print.current.db= true;
create table if not exists titanic (PassengerId int, Survived int, Pclass int, Name string, Sex string, Age int, SibSp int, parch int, Ticket string, Fare float, Cabin string, Embarked string) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile;
load data local inpath 'data/TitanicData.txt' into table titanic;

select Pclass, Avg(fare) from titanic group by Pclass;

3.In this problem statement we will find out number of male and female people died in each class(PIG)
